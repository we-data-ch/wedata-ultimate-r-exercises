    "text": "The aim of this website is to be a compendium of knowledge on R made by members of the WeData association. It should serve both as a reference for knowledge, and as an exercise interface. We hope to highlight some important themes in this book.\n\n\n\n\nIt is free\nData analysis and statics ecosystem\nBeautiful visualization capabilities\nAmazing reporting tools\nWeb application development\nVibrant and nice community\nWidely used in research\nKey tools in specific sectors\n\n\n\n\nWhy this website? To complete existing resources with exercises. In fact, there are already numerous free or paid resources on R scattered on the internet. The main concern is not about knowing if a resource exists but about finding it. Rarely do collaborative projects try to bring together various R resources in the form of a book or website. Here are some notable examples I know of (there are probably more):\n\nThe big book of R\nBookdown\nPyofile (R and Python books)\n\nIt is amusing to find excellent resources hidden in Rmarkdown and Quarto galleries. We believe that despite the dissemination of resources, the community is doing a fantastic job trying to consolidate them, and I strongly encourage anyone interested in contributing to this effort to feed the sources mentioned earlier. However, another problem remains: there is a glaring lack of exercises and interactive resources. It’s important to note that there are platforms for doing R exercises online to some degree of interactivity. Notable cases include Exercism, Codewars and W3school (for a more comprehensive list, check our blog post). There is also the learnr package, which allows creating interactive R exercises using Rmarkdown. The system is great (at least locally), but when it comes to putting exercises online for use without installing R, it requires an active server, adding more work and concerns, particularly regarding hosting and managing a large number of requests. Our goal would be to create an exercise platform that does not require running R on a server. Is this possible? The answer is yes!\n\nThe advancements in web technologies over the past few years have given us hope to create online interactive exercise platforms without a server, and it was only recently that the idea of reusing a system like learnr within webr (the Quarto extension) surfaced. These developments are very encouraging and have inspired the creation of this platform.\n\nOur association is made up of passionate individuals with varying levels, goals, and interests. But I believe we can create an interactive resource that allows curious people to train. The objective will be to create exercise series and recommend existing resources to help users complete the exercises.\n\nThis is new territory for me, and I don’t know if it will work. Perhaps I’m missing essential elements, or web pages might be unbelievably slow or inefficient. But I believe it’s worth a try!\n\n\n\nAs we said earlier, thanks to webr, it’s now possible to use R in the browser without the need for a server (a computer that’s always running). To be more precise, R is translated into WebAssembly, which runs in the browser. All thanks to webr. If you don’t believe me, you can try R in the browser here. Or you can test it just below using the code or writting yours:\n\nplot(cars)\n\nMagic! You can use it without an R, even on your cell phone!\nQuarto’s strength lies in its ability to integrate it so seamlessly into its ecosystem. This has enabled the same webr authors to create the quarto-live extension, which adds the elements needed to create online exercises. So we can easily create interactive online exercises simply by hosting our website on a GitHub repository, with no real performance problems.\nWe can thank quarto-live for this feat. Here is an example of an exercise suggested in the documentation:\nFilter the starwars dataset so that only the droid characters are included.\n\n#| setup: true\n#| exercise: ex_3\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n#| exercise: ex_3\nstarwars |&gt; ______\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider using the filter() function from dplyr.\nstarwars |&gt; filter(______)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should filter the dataset using the species column.\nstarwars |&gt; filter(species == ______)\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFully worked solution:\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the filter() function from dplyr:\n1starwars |&gt;\n2    filter(species == \"Droid\")\n\n1\n\nTake the starwars dataset, and then,\n\n2\n\nFilter for the “Droid” species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic! This allows you to have the capabilities of {learnr} without the need to install R or have a server to hold it all together. Note that quarto-live is still in its infancy and will probably improve over time."

    "text": "1. Basic concepts\nR can be used in different text editors, here are from the most preferred to the least preferred:\n\nRstudio\nPositron\nVisual Studio Code\nJupyter lab/notebook\nSublime text /Atom\nNeovim (only if you are experimented)\n\nR can be run in the following documents:\n\nRscripts (.r)\nRmarkdown notebook (.rmd)\nQuarto notebook (.qmd)\nJupyter notebook (.ipynb)\n\nYou need to install the R kernel for Jupyter notebook uses the following tutorial or you can try the ark kernel.\n\n\nRun a line (in a script or notebook) using Ctrl/Cmd+Enter and run code cells (in a notebook) by using Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Enter or pressing the “Play” button in the toolbar above on the “Run button” or on the cell.\nTo print out results, simply write print() with parentheses, but it is not compulsory in R to output a result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine 1: In R, comments begin with a #. This statement is ignored by the interpreter and serves as documentation for our code. The short cut for this is Ctrl+Maj+C or Cmd+Maj+C.\nLine 2: print(“Hello World!”) To print something on the console, print() function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed (unlike in C). Note that in R you can also use the cat() function for a more readable version:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: To see the document related to the function or library in:\n\nRStudio: appears automatically\nVScode: appears automatically or Ctrl+Space or hover the function\nJupyter lab/notebook: Shift+Tab.\n\nCurly brackets: Like many programming languages, R does not care about the spaces because it is always bound to brackets (parentheses, brackets or curly brackets). Indentation is only for aesthetic matter and users are free to indent their code following their taste (unlike Python or Nim that can have an indentation error). For example, the indentation of the second print() does not break the code since it is in the brackets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRstudio:\n\nCode is run inside an environment (R version, project and environment).

You need to install it firts with install.package(\"dplyr\") then load the library with library(dplyr):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo import a csv you can use the function read.csv() in base R, but the read_csv() in dplyr is faster and import everything as tibble table (an advanced kind of dataframe):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that to have access to the data, you do not need to write the full path, you can simply press the key Tab inside the quotation mark of a\nDisplay a dataframe:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the size of your dataframe:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the names of columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new column the base R way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new column with Tidyverse (without pipe):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR has a super power as a functional programming language. It can use pipes (|&gt; and %&gt;%). Those allows to pass the result of an operation to the next operation and therfore chain multiple operations. It allows to have a more readable code, easier to write and more composable. You can use 2 kinds of pipes:\n\nmagrittr pipe (%&gt;%): Powerful (can do more than the next one), it needs to be installed through a package of the Tidyverse (magrittr, dplyr, rvest, …).\nBase (|&gt;): useful, do not need any libraries\n\nSince we will use the dplyr, we will use magrittr pipe (%&gt;%). No need to write it, simply use the following shortcut Ctrl+Maj+M or Cmd+Maj+M. With a few try, it comes naturally. As said before the pipe use is to pass values through operations. For instance consider the following example printing the value of the variable a:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey both give the same result. However the pipe version is longer. The strength of the secon approach appear when we need more than one operation. For instance, imagine converting a to an integer before printing it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first one still looks more concise, but it is in fact slower and harder to write. You have to start by the print() statement (the end) and go backward until the beginning which is counter-intuitive. While with the pipe approach you can consider %&gt;% as a “and”. Writting it looks like, “I start with the variable ‘a’ AND I convert it into an integer AND I print it”.\nThis method scale also really well. Lets take a more extreme example. With the following steps:\n\nTranslate “a” into an integer\nCompute the log10\nCompute the square root\nPrint it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in this code we can put expressions following a pipe in the next line for more readability. But the whole code is considered by R as only one line. So, you can run the code from whatever line and it will run the whole expression.\nIt is even more complicated with the normal way and less readable. While with pipe you can read it like sentences connected by “AND”. Generally, when operation start to stack, we desagreggate them into multiple steps like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach is more readable. The issue with this approach is that we have changed the value of a multiple time. But if we want to go back in a step, we need to re-run all the step before. It seems like nothing, but in a longer code and more complex, you can easily be overwhelmed and lost track of the state of your variable. You could improve that by storing new values in different variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then we can create unecessary intermediate variables that have only no usage beside storing value that have no use in the rest of the code. Furthermore, both version are slower to write than the pipe version. Another advantage of the pipe function is that we can iteratively write the code and add and remove steps as needed. The when you are satisfied with the result, you can store it in a final variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pipes in dplyr allows to manipulate data frames steps by steps in a readable manner. But function from the tidyverse bring another strength. They always return data frame, makin the iteratino even easier since you keep everything, so modifying a single column won’t stop you to do other manipulation with other columns in the same chain. Let’s take the earlier example from the df dataframe and compute the mean of Open and Close columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last expression return a data frame and added the new column to the end. Again you are free to put the new result in a new object. Then you can select specific rows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine it with the previous operation to chain everything. The new dataset has a new column mean_value and is filterd to keep row when Close is bigger than Open:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can display the summary statistic of a given variable using the summary() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can do the same with the whole data frame:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also request specific statistics using the corresponding functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChaining is useful when we need to answer a specific question without changing the data frame. For instance, you can find the date when Volume was highest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut sometimes, it is faster to use base R for simple isolated operations. For instance, the Date column in df is note in the date format but in text format. We can change it in one line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to extract the specific value and not a data frame, you can use the pull() function instead of select():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots are very easy in ggplot2 with qplot()! But there is another notation that is more used, the layered one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks longer, but it is more flexible. It works like layers. Here is a short explanation of each part: - ggplot() initiate te figure - aes() map the column to different dimensions (x/y axis, color, line type, size, etc.) - geom_*() create a type of geometry - geom_line() create line using value from x and y\nThe aes() part is quite movable. You can decide to put it in a different place to update the graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get the same result. The advantage of using such an approach is that we can really be flexible in the parameter that we are using and also the number of layer that we can create:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust by changing the geom, we can have a large variety of plots. For instance here is a boxplot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the parameters are not compulsary as long as we keep theme in the righ order (x then y):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping the same structure, we can have different plots by changing the geom:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a whole subject by itself and the Tidyverse ecosystem (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, …) is an even bigger topic. We won’t talk about it here, but in future tutorials."

The type is derived from the value it was assigned.\n\ntypeof(x) # double\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(y) # double\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(z) # integer\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nIf we assign a new value to a variable, its type can change.\n\nx = \"cat\"\ntypeof(x)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nNote: Integer: represents positive or negative whole numbers like 3 or -512. Floating point number (double): represents real numbers like 3.14159 or -2.5. Character string: text.\nIf we try to use a variable that has not yet been defined we get an Error:\n\nh\n\nBut we can assign the value to a new variable from an existing variable:\n\nh &lt;- x\nh\n\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost operators and comparisons in R work as one would expect:\n\nArithmetic operators +, -, *, /, %/% (integer division), ^ power\n\n\n1 + 2 # Addition\n\n[1] 3\n\n1 - 2 # Substraction\n\n[1] -1\n\n1 * 2 # Multiplication\n\n[1] 2\n\n1 %/% 2 # Modulo\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\n1.0 + 2.0\n\n[1] 3\n\n1.0 - 2.0\n\n[1] -1\n\n1.0 * 2.0\n\n[1] 2\n\n1.0 %/% 2.0\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\n# Integer division of float numbers\n3.0 %/% 2.0\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n3^2 # 3 power of 2\n\n[1] 9\n\n\n\nThe boolean operators are spelled out as words. They are useful for condition (“if it is true or false”) and filtering data.\n\n\nTRUE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nFALSE\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\nNote the use of & (and), ! (not) and | (or).\n\n\nTRUE & FALSE # FALSE win\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n!FALSE # Inverse\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nTRUE | FALSE # TRUE win\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nComparison operators can create booleans: &gt;, &lt;, &gt;= (greater or equal), &lt;= (less or equal), == equality.\n\n\n2&gt;1 # Is 2 bigger than 1?\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n2&lt;1 # Is 2 smaller than 1?\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n2&gt;2 # Is 2 bigger than 2?\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n2&lt;2 # Is 2 smaller than 2?\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n2&gt;=2 # Is 2 bigger than or equal 2?\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n2&lt;=2 # Is 2 smaller than or equal to 2?\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nand (&): means that both condition most be true to return TRUE\nor (|): means that least one condition need to be true tu return TRUE\n\n\n\n2&gt;1 & 3&gt;4 # is 2 bigger than 1 AND 3 bigger than 4?\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n2&gt;1 | 3&gt;4 # is 2 bigger than 1 OR 3 bigger than 4?\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nIt works with vectors:\n\nc(0, 5, 10, 15) &gt; 2\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nSo it is possible to filter vectors\n\nvector_to_filter &lt;- c(3, 6, 9, 12)\n\nvector_to_filter[vector_to_filter &gt; 5] # Keep all the value bigger than 5\n\n[1]  6  9 12\n\n\nThere are other\n\n# equality \nsetequal(c(1,2,3), c(3,4,5))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# are the elements in the left in the vector on the right?\nc(1,2,3) %in% c(3,4,5)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrings are the variable type that is used for storing text messages. To declare string variables, include quotes; either single or double. E.g:\n\ns = \"Hello world\"\ntypeof(s)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIn R, characters are one element of a vector. To collect the length of a character, we need to use a specific function (since length() only return on 1 for characters).\n\n# classic lenght\nnchar(s)\n\n[1] 11\n\n# print the length of a string (i.e. the number of characters)\nlength(s)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n# replace a substring in a string with somethign else\ns2 = gsub(s, \"world\", \"test\")\ns2\n\n[1] \"test\"\n\n\nWe can index a character in a string using [] after the function strsplit(character, \"\")[[1]][1]:\n\ns3 = strsplit(s, \"\")[[1]]\ns3\n\n [1] \"H\" \"e\" \"l\" \"l\" \"o\" \" \" \"w\" \"o\" \"r\" \"l\" \"d\"\n\ns3[1]\n\n[1] \"H\"\n\n\nNote that in R head() allows to do an ordered selection (like []) while tail() do the same backwards.\n\nhead(s3, 3)\n\n[1] \"H\" \"e\" \"l\"\n\ntail(s3, 1)\n\n[1] \"d\"\n\n\nWe can extract a part of a string using the syntax [start:stop], which extracts characters between index start and stop:\n\ns3[2:4]\n\n[1] \"e\" \"l\" \"l\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLists are very similar to vector, except that each element can be of any type.\nThe syntax for creating lists in R is list(...):\n\nstring_list = list('spring', 'summer', 'winter', 'fall')\nstring_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"spring\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"summer\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"winter\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"fall\"\n\n\n\ninteger_list = list(12, 3, 5, 3, 9, 6, 2)\ninteger_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 12\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 9\n\n[[6]]\n[1] 6\n\n[[7]]\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nfloat_list = list(2.3, 4.6, 3.7, 8.3)\nfloat_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 2.3\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4.6\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 3.7\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 8.3\n\n\nTo access variables in a list:\n\nstring_list &lt;- list(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\")\nstring_list[[1]] # note that indexing starts at 1 in R!\n\n[1] \"a\"\n\n\n\n\n\n# create a new empty list\nl &lt;- list()\n\n# add elements using `append`\nl &lt;- append(l, \"A\")\nl &lt;- append(l, \"d\")\n\nl\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"A\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"d\"\n\n\nWe can modify lists by assigning new values to elements in the list. In technical jargon, lists are mutable.\n\nl[[2]] &lt;- \"p\"\n\nl\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"A\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"p\"\n\n\nWe can insert an element at a specific index using append\n\nl &lt;- append(l, \"i\", 0)\nl &lt;- append(l, \"n\", 1)\nl &lt;- append(l, \"s\", 2)\nl &lt;- append(l, \"e\", 3)\nl &lt;- append(l, \"r\", 4)\nl &lt;- append(l, \"t\", 5)\n\nl\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"i\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"n\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"s\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"e\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"r\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"t\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"A\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"p\"\n\n\nRemove elements with remove\n\nl &lt;- l[l != \"A\"]\n\nl\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"i\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"n\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"s\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"e\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"r\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"t\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"p\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists are not the best method for quick and concise calculations or operations. Vectors are more appropriate. This is because vectors always have the same type, so calculations are easier for the computer (which can anticipate all the steps and therefore optimize). Lists come in handy when we want to have a collection of elements that have different types and names.\nList are also like vectors, except that each element is a key-value pair. The syntax for lists is list(key1 = value1, ...).\n\nstudent &lt;- list(hair = c(\"brown\", \"pink\"), \n                eye = \"black\", \n                height = 172)\n\nclass(student)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstudent\n\n$hair\n[1] \"brown\" \"pink\" \n\n$eye\n[1] \"black\"\n\n$height\n[1] 172\n\n\nTo access keys:\n\nnames(student)\n\n[1] \"hair\"   \"eye\"    \"height\"\n\n\nTo access values of the keys:\n\nunlist(student)\n\n  hair1   hair2     eye  height \n\"brown\"  \"pink\" \"black\"   \"172\" \n\n\nTo access an item of a key:\n\nstudent$eye\n\n[1] \"black\"\n\n# or\nstudent[[\"eye\"]]\n\n[1] \"black\"\n\n\nTo change the value of a key:\n\nstudent$eye &lt;- 'blue'\n# or\nstudent[[\"eye\"]]\n\n[1] \"blue\"\n\n\nTo add a new entry:\n\nstudent$nationality &lt;- 'Spanish'\n# or\nstudent[[\"nationality\"]] &lt;- 'Spanish'\n\n\nstudent\n\n$hair\n[1] \"brown\" \"pink\" \n\n$eye\n[1] \"blue\"\n\n$height\n[1] 172\n\n$nationality\n[1] \"Spanish\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can take an user input using using the readline() function. Not that if you are using it in a chunk you still have to interact with the code in the console:\n\nRun the chunk\nGo to the console\nAnswer the question “what is you names:” with a text\nGo back to the chunk\n\n\n# Input \nname &lt;- readline(prompt=\"What is your name: \")\npaste(\"My name is\", name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can execute your code conditionally by dividing it into different parts and setting conditions for running each specific part.\nThe R syntax for conditional execution of code use the keywords if, else if, else:\n\nYou can play with this by changin the value of statement1 and statement2 by TRUE or FALSE\n\n\nstatement1 &lt;- FALSE\nstatement2 &lt;- FALSE\n\nif (statement1) { # \"if statement1 is TRUE\" do the following:\n    \"statement1 is TRUE\"\n} else if (statement2) { # \"otherwise if statement2 is TRUE\" do the following:\"\n    \"statement2 is TRUE\"\n} else { # \"therwise do the following:\"\n    \"statement1 and statement2 are FALSE\"\n}\n\n[1] \"statement1 and statement2 are FALSE\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, loops can be programmed in a number of different ways. The most common is the for loop, which is used together with iterable objects, such as lists. The basic syntax is:\n\n\n\nfor (x in 1:3) {# for each element of the list print it\n    print(x)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n\n\nNote that in this case, the function print() is necessary.\nTo iterate over key-value pairs of a list:\n\nfor (key in names(student)) { # for each key of the list print \"[key] = [value]\"\n    print(paste(key, \"=\", student[[key]]))\n}\n\n[1] \"hair = brown\" \"hair = pink\" \n[1] \"eye = blue\"\n[1] \"height = 172\"\n[1] \"nationality = Spanish\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of passing each element of a list, it is possible to set the condition that a code is executed as long as a specific condition is met. You can run the whole chunk to see it in action:\n\ni &lt;- 0\n\nwhile (i &lt; 5) { # \"while i is smaller than 5 run the following code:\"\n    print(i) \n    i &lt;- i + 1 \n}\n\n[1] 0\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n\n\"done\" # Appears if done\n\n[1] \"done\"\n\n\nNote that the print(\"done\") statement is not part of the while loop body because of the difference in indentation.\n\n# example of for loop and if statement: \n# for each value in the list \"integer_list\" print a value that is greater or equal to 7\ninteger_list &lt;- c(5, 7, 9, 3, 8)\n\nfor (x in integer_list) {\n    if (x &gt;= 7) { \n        print(x)\n    }\n}\n\n[1] 7\n[1] 9\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA function in R is defined using the keyword function, followed by a function name, a signature within parentheses (), and a curly brace {. The following code, with one additional level of indentation, is the function body. It return nothing but the function is available now.\n\nsquare &lt;- function(x) { # for a given value x do the following:\n    return(x^2) # Return the square of x.\n}\n\nYou can use your new function on any value:\n\nsquare(4)\n\n[1] 16\n\nsquare(10)\n\n[1] 100\n\n\nNote that you are not forced to use the return statement in the function, R will return the last value automatically:\n\nsquare &lt;- function(x) { # for a given value x do the following:\n    x^2 # Return the square of x.\n}\n\nsquare(4)\n\n[1] 16\n\n\nYou can even make it shorter by removing the brackets and putting everything in a single line:\n\nsquare &lt;- function(x) x^2\n\nsquare(4)\n\n[1] 16\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the functionality in R is provided by packages. The R Standard Library is a large collection of packages that provides cross-platform implementations of common facilities such as access to the operating system, file I/O, string management, network communication, and much more.\nTo use a package in an R program it first has to be installed. A quickest way is to do it here using the install.packages statement. For example, to install the package ggplot2, which is a useful package for plots, we can do:\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nTo use a package in an R program it first has to be imported. A package can be imported using the library statement. For example, to import the package ggplot2, which contains many standard plotting functions, we can do:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: le package 'ggplot2' a été compilé avec la version R 4.2.3\n\n\nThis includes the whole package and makes it available for use later in the program.\nNote that R can creat plot without packages. But ggplot2 bring beautiful and modular graphs. Let’s try it! For instance, R have built-in datasets that we can use. For instance we can invoke the cars dataset by simply calling it if it is for a short usecase:\n\ncars\n\n   speed dist\n1      4    2\n2      4   10\n3      7    4\n4      7   22\n5      8   16\n6

same:\n\nqplot(speed, dist, data = cars)\n\nWarning: `qplot()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a package is imported, we can list the symbols it provides using the ls function:\n\nls(\"package:ggplot2\")\n\n  [1] \"%+%\"                        \"%+replace%\"                \n  [3] \"aes\"                        \"aes_\"                      \n  [5] \"aes_all\"

However, the dplyr make this manipulation easier. You need to install it firts with install.package(\"dplyr\") then load the library with library(dplyr):\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nTo import a csv you can use the function read.csv() in base R, but the read_csv() in dplyr is faster and import everything as tibble table (an advanced kind of dataframe):\n\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"data.csv\")\n\nNote that to have access to the data, you do not need to write the full path, you can simply press the key Tab inside the quotation mark of a\nDisplay a dataframe:\n\ndf\n\n        Date   Open   High    Low  Close   Volume Adj.Close\n1 2012-06-01 569.16 590.00 548.50 584.00 14077000    581.50\n2 2012-05-01 584.90 596.76 522.18 577.73 18827900    575.26\n3 2012-04-02 601.83 644.00 555.00 583.98 28759100    581.48\n4 2012-03-01 548.17 621.45 516.22 599.55 26486000    596.99\n5 2012-02-01 458.41 547.61 453.98 542.44 22001000    540.12\n6 2012-01-03 409.40 458.24 409.00 456.48 12949100    454.53\n\n\nDisplay the size of your dataframe:\n\ndim(df) # this is number of (rows, columns)\n\n[1] 6 7\n\nnrow(df) # Number of rows\n\n[1] 6\n\nncol(df) # Number of cols\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nDisplay the names of columns:\n\ncolnames(df)\n\n[1] \"Date\"      \"Open\"      \"High\"      \"Low\"       \"Close\"     \"Volume\"   \n[7] \"Adj.Close\"\n\n# or\nnames(df)\n\n[1] \"Date\"      \"Open\"      \"High\"      \"Low\"       \"Close\"     \"Volume\"   \n[7] \"Adj.Close\"\n\n\nCreate a new column the base R way:\n\n# compute the average between Open and Close\ndf$mean_value &lt;- (df$Open+df$Close)/2\ndf$mean_value\n\n[1] 576.580 581.315 592.905 573.860 500.425 432.940\n\n\nCreate a new column with Tidyverse (without pipe):\n\n# axis=0 refer to columns \ndf$mean_value &lt;- colMeans(select(df, Open, Close))\ndf$mean_value\n\n[1] 528.6450 557.3633 528.6450 557.3633 528.6450 557.3633\n\n\nR has a super power as a functional programming language. It can use pipes (|&gt; and %&gt;%). Those allows to pass the result of an operation to the next operation and therfore chain multiple operations. It allows to have a more readable code, easier to write and more composable. You can use 2 kinds of pipes:\n\nmagrittr pipe (%&gt;%): Powerful (can do more than the next one), it needs to be installed through a package of the Tidyverse (magrittr, dplyr, rvest, …).\nBase (|&gt;): useful, do not need any libraries\n\nSince we will use the dplyr, we will use magrittr pipe (%&gt;%). No need to write it, simply use the following shortcut Ctrl+Maj+M or Cmd+Maj+M. With a few try, it comes naturally. As said before the pipe use is to pass values through operations. For instance consider the following example printing the value of the variable a:\n\na &lt;- \"12\"\n\n# Normal way\nprint(a)\n\n[1] \"12\"\n\n# With a pipe\na %&gt;% print()\n\n[1] \"12\"\n\n\nThey both give the same result. However the pipe version is longer. The strength of the secon approach appear when we need more than one operation. For instance, imagine converting a to an integer before printing it:\n\n# Normal way\nprint(as.integer(a))\n\n[1] 12\n\n# With pipes\na %&gt;% as.integer() %&gt;% print()\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nThe first one still looks more concise, but it is in fact slower and harder to write. You have to start by the print() statement (the end) and go backward until the beginning which is counter-intuitive. While with the pipe approach you can consider %&gt;% as a “and”. Writting it looks like, “I start with the variable ‘a’ AND I convert it into an integer AND I print it”.\nThis method scale also really well. Lets take a more extreme example. With the following steps:\n\nTranslate “a” into an integer\nCompute the log10\nCompute the square root\nPrint it\n\n\n# Normal way\nprint(sqrt(log10(as.integer(a))))\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n# with pipes\na %&gt;% \n  as.integer() %&gt;% \n  log10() %&gt;% \n  sqrt() %&gt;% \n  print()\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nNote that in this code we can put expressions following a pipe in the next line for more readability. But the whole code is considered by R as only one line. So, you can run the code from whatever line and it will run the whole expression.\nIt is even more complicated with the normal way and less readable. While with pipe you can read it like sentences connected by “AND”. Generally, when operation start to stack, we desagreggate them into multiple steps like this:\n\na &lt;- as.integer(a)\na &lt;- log10(a)\na &lt;- sqrt(a)\nprint(a)\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nThis approach is more readable. The issue with this approach is that we have changed the value of a multiple time. But if we want to go back in a step, we need to re-run all the step before. It seems like nothing, but in a longer code and more complex, you can easily be overwhelmed and lost track of the state of your variable. You could improve that by storing new values in different variables:\n\na &lt;- 12\n\na1 &lt;- as.integer(a)\na2 &lt;- log10(a1)\na3 &lt;- sqrt(a2)\nprint(a3)\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nBut then we can create unecessary intermediate variables that have only no usage beside storing value that have no use in the rest of the code. Furthermore, both version are slower to write than the pipe version. Another advantage of the pipe function is that we can iteratively write the code and add and remove steps as needed. The when you are satisfied with the result, you can store it in a final variable:\n\nresult &lt;- \n  a %&gt;% \n  as.integer() %&gt;% \n  log10() %&gt;% \n  sqrt() %&gt;% \n  print()\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nThe pipes in dplyr allows to manipulate data frames steps by steps in a readable manner. But function from the tidyverse bring another strength. They always return data frame, makin the iteratino even easier since you keep everything, so modifying a single column won’t stop you to do other manipulation with other columns in the same chain. Let’s take the earlier example from the df dataframe and compute the mean of Open and Close columns.\n\n# compute the average between Open and Close\ndf$mean_value &lt;- (df$Open+df$Close)/2\n\n# With pipe\ndf %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_value = (Open+Close)/2)\n\n        Date   Open   High    Low  Close   Volume Adj.Close mean_value\n1 2012-06-01 569.16 590.00 548.50 584.00 14077000    581.50    576.580\n2 2012-05-01 584.90 596.76 522.18 577.73 18827900    575.26    581.315\n3 2012-04-02 601.83 644.00 555.00 583.98 28759100    581.48    592.905\n4 2012-03-01 548.17 621.45 516.22 599.55 26486000    596.99    573.860\n5 2012-02-01 458.41 547.61 453.98 542.44 22001000    540.12    500.425\n6 2012-01-03 409.40 458.24 409.00 456.48 12949100    454.53    432.940\n\n\nThe last expression return a data frame and added the new column to the end. Again you are free to put the new result in a new object. Then you can select specific rows:\n\n# Filtering\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Close &gt; Open) # keep row when Close is bigger than Open\n\n        Date   Open   High    Low  Close   Volume Adj.Close mean_value\n1 2012-06-01 569.16 590.00 548.50 584.00 14077000    581.50    576.580\n2 2012-03-01 548.17 621.45 516.22 599.55 26486000    596.99    573.860\n3 2012-02-01 458.41 547.61 453.98 542.44 22001000    540.12    500.425\n4 2012-01-03 409.40 458.24 409.00 456.48 12949100    454.53    432.940\n\n\nWe can combine it with the previous operation to chain everything. The new dataset has a new column mean_value and is filterd to keep row when Close is bigger than Open:\n\n# Filtering after mutating\ndf %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_value = (Open+Close)/2) %&gt;% \n  filter(Close &gt; Open)\n\n        Date   Open   High    Low  Close   Volume Adj.Close mean_value\n1 2012-06-01 569.16 590.00 548.50 584.00 14077000    581.50    576.580\n2 2012-03-01 548.17 621.45 516.22 599.55 26486000    596.99    573.860\n3 2012-02-01 458.41 547.61 453.98 542.44 22001000    540.12    500.425\n4 2012-01-03 409.40 458.24 409.00 456.48 12949100    454.53    432.940\n\n\nYou can display the summary statistic of a given variable using the summary() function.\n\nsummary(df$High)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

For instance, you can find the date when Volume was highest:\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Volume == max(Volume)) %&gt;% \n  select(Date)\n\n        Date\n1 2012-04-02\n\n\nBut sometimes, it is faster to use base R for simple isolated operations. For instance, the Date column in df is note in the date format but in text format. We can change it in one line:\n\n# Check the type of Date\nclass(df$Date)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# Change the type of Date as a date\ndf$Date &lt;- as.Date(df$Date)\n\n# Check the type of Date\nclass(df$Date) \n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nIf you want to extract the specific value and not a data frame, you can use the pull() function instead of select():\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Volume == max(Volume)) %&gt;% \n  pull(Date)\n\n[1] \"2012-04-02\"\n\n\nPlots are very easy in ggplot2 with qplot()! But there is another notation that is more used, the layered one:\n\n# Easy way\nqplot(Date, Open, data = df, geom = \"line\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Layered way\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Open)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks longer, but it is more flexible. It works like layers. Here is a short explanation of each part: - ggplot() initiate te figure - aes() map the column to different dimensions (x/y axis, color, line type, size, etc.) - geom_*() create a type of geometry - geom_line() create line using value from x and y\nThe aes() part is quite movable. You can decide to put it in a different place to update the graph:\n\n# Different place, same result\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=Open))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get the same result. The advantage of using such an approach is that we can really be flexible in the parameter that we are using and also the number of layer that we can create:\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Date)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y=Open, color=\"Open\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=High, color=\"High\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=Low, color=\"Low\")) + \n  geom_line(aes(y=Close, color=\"Close\")) +\n  theme_bw() # Add a new theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust by changing the geom, we can have a large variety of plots. For instance here is a boxplot:\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the parameters are not compulsary as long as we keep theme in the righ order (x then y):\n\n# Parameters\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# No parameters\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping the same structure, we can have different plots by changing the geom:\n\n# Boxplot\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Histogram\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Density\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a whole subject by itself and the Tidyverse ecosystem (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, …) is an even bigger topic. We won’t talk about it here, but in future tutorials."

This statement is ignored by the interpreter and serves as documentation for our code. The short cut for this is Ctrl+Maj+C or Cmd+Maj+C.\nLine 2: print(“Hello World!”) To print something on the console, print() function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed (unlike in C). Note that in R you can also use the cat() function for a more readable version:\n\nprint(\"Hello\\nWorld\") # print as it is\n\n[1] \"Hello\\nWorld\"\n\ncat(\"Hello\\nWorld!\") # print a readable version\n\nHello\nWorld!\n\n\nNote: To see the document related to the function or library in:\n\nRStudio: appears automatically\nVScode: appears automatically or Ctrl+Space or hover the function\nJupyter lab/notebook: Shift+Tab.\n\nCurly brackets: Like many programming languages, R does not care about the spaces because it is always bound to brackets (parentheses, brackets or curly brackets). Indentation is only for aesthetic matter and users are free to indent their code following their taste (unlike Python or Nim that can have an indentation error). For example, the indentation of the second print() does not break the code since it is in the brackets:\n\nif (3==3){\n  print(\"TRUE\")\n} else {\n                  print(\"FALSE\")\n}\n\n[1] \"TRUE\"\n\n\nRstudio:\n\nCode is run inside an environment (R version, project and environment). It can always be stopped by pressing the “Stop” button or Ctrl+C shortcut (inside quarto/rmarkdown notebook or a script).\n\nJupyter lab/notebook:\n\nCode is run in a separate process called the Kernel. The Kernel can be interrupted or restarted. Try running the following cell and then hit the “Stop” button in the toolbar above or by clicking the right button on the script in jupyter Lab.\n\nIndexing in R starts at 1, which means that the first element in a sequence has an index of 1, the second element has an index of 2, and so on as expected.\n\n# Vector\nnumber_vector = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n# List\nnumber_list = list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Vector's first element\nnumber_vector[1]\n\n[1] 1\n\n# List's first element\nnumber_list[[1]]\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nNote: You need a double bracket to have access to a list element (see last lines of code).\nTips: You can generate a continuous vector between two values using the sign : as follows:\n\n1:10 # 1 to 10\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n3:-8 # 3 to -8\n\n [1]  3  2  1  0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8\n\n\nYou can also decide to use specific steps to get from one value to another using the seq() function:\n\nseq(0, 10, 2) # From 0 to 10 by steps of 2\n\n[1]  0  2  4  6  8 10\n\nseq(-5, 5, 5) # From-5 to 5 by steps of 5\n\n[1] -5  0  5\n\n\nR reserved words\nR has reserved words that you can use as a variable name (except if you surround it by `).

  9   10\n7     10   18\n8     10   26\n9     10   34\n10    11   17\n11    11   28\n12    12   14\n13    12   20\n14    12   24\n15    12   28\n16    13   26\n17    13   34\n18    13   34\n19    13   46\n20    14   26\n21    14   36\n22    14   60\n23    14   80\n24    15   20\n25    15   26\n26    15   54\n27    16   32\n28    16   40\n29    17   32\n30    17   40\n31    17   50\n32    18   42\n33    18   56\n34    18   76\n35    18   84\n36    19   36\n37    19   46\n38    19   68\n39    20   32\n40    20   48\n41    20   52\n42    20   56\n43    20   64\n44    22   66\n45    23   54\n46    24   70\n47    24   92\n48    24   93\n49    24  120\n50    25   85\n\n\nThen we can then plot it using the plot() function:\n\nplot(cars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot allow to do the same:\n\nqplot(speed, dist, data = cars)\n\nWarning: `qplot()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a package is imported, we can list the symbols it provides using the ls function:\n\nls(\"package:ggplot2\")\n\n  [1] \"%+%\"                        \"%+replace%\"                \n  [3] \"aes\"                        \"aes_\"                      \n  [5] \"aes_all\"

It can use pipes (|&gt; and %&gt;%). Those allows to pass the result of an operation to the next operation and therfore chain multiple operations. It allows to have a more readable code, easier to write and more composable. You can use 2 kinds of pipes:\n\nmagrittr pipe (%&gt;%): Powerful (can do more than the next one), it needs to be installed through a package of the Tidyverse (magrittr, dplyr, rvest, …).\nBase (|&gt;): useful, do not need any libraries\n\nSince we will use the dplyr, we will use magrittr pipe (%&gt;%). No need to write it, simply use the following shortcut Ctrl+Maj+M or Cmd+Maj+M. With a few try, it comes naturally. As said before the pipe use is to pass values through operations. For instance consider the following example printing the value of the variable a:\n\na &lt;- \"12\"\n\n# Normal way\nprint(a)\n\n[1] \"12\"\n\n# With a pipe\na %&gt;% print()\n\n[1] \"12\"\n\n\nThey both give the same result. However the pipe version is longer. The strength of the secon approach appear when we need more than one operation. For instance, imagine converting a to an integer before printing it:\n\n# Normal way\nprint(as.integer(a))\n\n[1] 12\n\n# With pipes\na %&gt;% as.integer() %&gt;% print()\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nThe first one still looks more concise, but it is in fact slower and harder to write. You have to start by the print() statement (the end) and go backward until the beginning which is counter-intuitive. While with the pipe approach you can consider %&gt;% as a “and”. Writting it looks like, “I start with the variable ‘a’ AND I convert it into an integer AND I print it”.\nThis method scale also really well. Lets take a more extreme example. With the following steps:\n\nTranslate “a” into an integer\nCompute the log10\nCompute the square root\nPrint it\n\n\n# Normal way\nprint(sqrt(log10(as.integer(a))))\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n# with pipes\na %&gt;% \n  as.integer() %&gt;% \n  log10() %&gt;% \n  sqrt() %&gt;% \n  print()\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nNote that in this code we can put expressions following a pipe in the next line for more readability. But the whole code is considered by R as only one line. So, you can run the code from whatever line and it will run the whole expression.\nIt is even more complicated with the normal way and less readable. While with pipe you can read it like sentences connected by “AND”. Generally, when operation start to stack, we desagreggate them into multiple steps like this:\n\na &lt;- as.integer(a)\na &lt;- log10(a)\na &lt;- sqrt(a)\nprint(a)\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nThis approach is more readable. The issue with this approach is that we have changed the value of a multiple time. But if we want to go back in a step, we need to re-run all the step before. It seems like nothing, but in a longer code and more complex, you can easily be overwhelmed and lost track of the state of your variable. You could improve that by storing new values in different variables:\n\na &lt;- 12\n\na1 &lt;- as.integer(a)\na2 &lt;- log10(a1)\na3 &lt;- sqrt(a2)\nprint(a3)\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nBut then we can create unecessary intermediate variables that have only no usage beside storing value that have no use in the rest of the code. Furthermore, both version are slower to write than the pipe version. Another advantage of the pipe function is that we can iteratively write the code and add and remove steps as needed. The when you are satisfied with the result, you can store it in a final variable:\n\nresult &lt;- \n  a %&gt;% \n  as.integer() %&gt;% \n  log10() %&gt;% \n  sqrt() %&gt;% \n  print()\n\n[1] 1.038836\n\n\nThe pipes in dplyr allows to manipulate data frames steps by steps in a readable manner. But function from the tidyverse bring another strength. They always return data frame, makin the iteratino even easier since you keep everything, so modifying a single column won’t stop you to do other manipulation with other columns in the same chain. Let’s take the earlier example from the df dataframe and compute the mean of Open and Close columns.\n\n# compute the average between Open and Close\ndf$mean_value &lt;- (df$Open+df$Close)/2\n\n# With pipe\ndf %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_value = (Open+Close)/2)\n\n        Date   Open   High    Low  Close   Volume Adj.Close mean_value\n1 2012-06-01 569.16 590.00 548.50 584.00 14077000    581.50    576.580\n2 2012-05-01 584.90 596.76 522.18 577.73 18827900    575.26    581.315\n3 2012-04-02 601.83 644.00 555.00 583.98 28759100    581.48    592.905\n4 2012-03-01 548.17 621.45 516.22 599.55 26486000    596.99    573.860\n5 2012-02-01 458.41 547.61 453.98 542.44 22001000    540.12    500.425\n6 2012-01-03 409.40 458.24 409.00 456.48 12949100    454.53    432.940\n\n\nThe last expression return a data frame and added the new column to the end. Again you are free to put the new result in a new object. Then you can select specific rows:\n\n# Filtering\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Close &gt; Open) # keep row when Close is bigger than Open\n\n        Date   Open   High    Low  Close   Volume Adj.Close mean_value\n1 2012-06-01 569.16 590.00 548.50 584.00 14077000    581.50    576.580\n2 2012-03-01 548.17 621.45 516.22 599.55 26486000    596.99    573.860\n3 2012-02-01 458.41 547.61 453.98 542.44 22001000    540.12    500.425\n4 2012-01-03 409.40 458.24 409.00 456.48 12949100    454.53    432.940\n\n\nWe can combine it with the previous operation to chain everything. The new dataset has a new column mean_value and is filterd to keep row when Close is bigger than Open:\n\n# Filtering after mutating\ndf %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_value = (Open+Close)/2) %&gt;% \n  filter(Close &gt; Open)\n\n        Date   Open   High    Low  Close   Volume Adj.Close mean_value\n1 2012-06-01 569.16 590.00 548.50 584.00 14077000    581.50    576.580\n2 2012-03-01 548.17 621.45 516.22 599.55 26486000    596.99    573.860\n3 2012-02-01 458.41 547.61 453.98 542.44 22001000    540.12    500.425\n4 2012-01-03 409.40 458.24 409.00 456.48 12949100    454.53    432.940\n\n\nYou can display the summary statistic of a given variable using the summary() function.\n\nsummary(df$High)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

For instance, you can find the date when Volume was highest:\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Volume == max(Volume)) %&gt;% \n  select(Date)\n\n        Date\n1 2012-04-02\n\n\nBut sometimes, it is faster to use base R for simple isolated operations. For instance, the Date column in df is note in the date format but in text format. We can change it in one line:\n\n# Check the type of Date\nclass(df$Date)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# Change the type of Date as a date\ndf$Date &lt;- as.Date(df$Date)\n\n# Check the type of Date\nclass(df$Date) \n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nIf you want to extract the specific value and not a data frame, you can use the pull() function instead of select():\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Volume == max(Volume)) %&gt;% \n  pull(Date)\n\n[1] \"2012-04-02\"\n\n\nPlots are very easy in ggplot2 with qplot()! But there is another notation that is more used, the layered one:\n\n# Easy way\nqplot(Date, Open, data = df, geom = \"line\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Layered way\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Open)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks longer, but it is more flexible. It works like layers. Here is a short explanation of each part: - ggplot() initiate te figure - aes() map the column to different dimensions (x/y axis, color, line type, size, etc.) - geom_*() create a type of geometry - geom_line() create line using value from x and y\nThe aes() part is quite movable. You can decide to put it in a different place to update the graph:\n\n# Different place, same result\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=Open))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get the same result. The advantage of using such an approach is that we can really be flexible in the parameter that we are using and also the number of layer that we can create:\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Date)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y=Open, color=\"Open\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=High, color=\"High\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=Low, color=\"Low\")) + \n  geom_line(aes(y=Close, color=\"Close\")) +\n  theme_bw() # Add a new theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust by changing the geom, we can have a large variety of plots. For instance here is a boxplot:\n\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the parameters are not compulsary as long as we keep theme in the righ order (x then y):\n\n# Parameters\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# No parameters\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping the same structure, we can have different plots by changing the geom:\n\n# Boxplot\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Histogram\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Density\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Close)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a whole subject by itself and the Tidyverse ecosystem (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, …) is an even bigger topic. We won’t talk about it here, but in future tutorials."

    "text": "R is a powerful programming language for statistical computing and data analysis. Originally developed by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in the 1990s, R has become a leading tool for data science, statistical analysis, and data visualization.\n\n\n\nStatistical Focus: R was built specifically for statistical analysis and offers a vast array of statistical methods and tests.\nGraphics Capabilities: Excellent for creating high-quality visualizations with packages like ggplot2.\nExtensibility: Thousands of packages available through CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) extend R’s functionality.\nOpen Source: Free and open-source, with a strong community of users and developers.\nInteractive Environment: The R console provides immediate feedback, making it ideal for data exploration.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you start R, you’re presented with a console where you can enter commands. The console interprets each command and returns results immediately.\nR functions as a sophisticated calculator, capable of handling basic arithmetic operations and much more. Here are some basic operations you can perform:\n# Addition\n5 + 3  # Returns 8\n\n# Subtraction\n10 - 4  # Returns 6\n\n# Multiplication\n6 * 7  # Returns 42\n\n# Division\n20 / 5  # Returns 4\n\n# Exponentiation (Power)\n2^3  # Returns 8\n\n\n\nPerform the following operations in R: 1. Add 25 and 75 2. Multiply 10 by 5 3. Divide 100 by 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the standard arithmetic operators: + for addition, * for multiplication, and / for division.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n# Addition\n25 + 75\n\n# Multiplication\n10 * 5\n\n# Division\n100 / 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR allows you to add comments to your code to explain what it does. Comments start with the # symbol and are ignored by R when executing code.\nR automatically prints the result of a calculation or command if it’s not assigned to a variable. This feature is useful for quick calculations and checking intermediate results.\nYou can also explicitly print values using the print() function, which is especially useful when working with scripts where automatic printing doesn’t occur.\n# This is a comment that R ignores\n\n# Automatic printing example\n42  # R will output 42\n\n# Print function example\nprint(\"Hello\")  # Explicitly prints \"Hello\"\n\n\n\nPractice printing values and adding comments to your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse # to add comments. R will automatically print the result of an expression if it’s not assigned to a variable. You can also use the print() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n# This is a comment - it won't be executed\n\n# Automatic printing\n42\n\n# Print function\nprint(\"Hello, R world!\")\n\n# Multiple operations\n2 + 2\nprint(10 * 5)"

Originally developed by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in the 1990s, R has become a leading tool for data science, statistical analysis, and data visualization.\n\n\n\nStatistical Focus: R was built specifically for statistical analysis and offers a vast array of statistical methods and tests.\nGraphics Capabilities: Excellent for creating high-quality visualizations with packages like ggplot2.\nExtensibility: Thousands of packages available through CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) extend R’s functionality.\nOpen Source: Free and open-source, with a strong community of users and developers.\nInteractive Environment: The R console provides immediate feedback, making it ideal for data exploration.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you start R, you’re presented with a console where you can enter commands. The console interprets each command and returns results immediately.\nR functions as a sophisticated calculator, capable of handling basic arithmetic operations and much more. Here are some basic operations you can perform:\n# Addition\n5 + 3  # Returns 8\n\n# Subtraction\n10 - 4  # Returns 6\n\n# Multiplication\n6 * 7  # Returns 42\n\n# Division\n20 / 5  # Returns 4\n\n# Exponentiation (Power)\n2^3  # Returns 8\n\n\n\nPerform the following operations in R: 1. Add 25 and 75 2. Multiply 10 by 5 3. Divide 100 by 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the standard arithmetic operators: + for addition, * for multiplication, and / for division.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n# Addition\n25 + 75\n\n# Multiplication\n10 * 5\n\n# Division\n100 / 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR allows you to add comments to your code to explain what it does. Comments start with the # symbol and are ignored by R when executing code.\nR automatically prints the result of a calculation or command if it’s not assigned to a variable. This feature is useful for quick calculations and checking intermediate results.\nYou can also explicitly print values using the print() function, which is especially useful when working with scripts where automatic printing doesn’t occur.\n# This is a comment that R ignores\n\n# Automatic printing example\n42  # R will output 42\n\n# Print function example\nprint(\"Hello\")  # Explicitly prints \"Hello\"\n\n\n\nPractice printing values and adding comments to your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse # to add comments. R will automatically print the result of an expression if it’s not assigned to a variable. You can also use the print() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n# This is a comment - it won't be executed\n\n# Automatic printing\n42\n\n# Print function\nprint(\"Hello, R world!\")\n\n# Multiple operations\n2 + 2\nprint(10 * 5)"

    "text": "Names and Assignment\nIn R, you can store values in variables for later use. This is done using the assignment operator, which can be either &lt;- or =. The &lt;- operator is more commonly used in R programming.\n\nVariable Assignment\nWhen you assign a value to a variable, R stores that value in memory. You can then use the variable name to refer to that value in subsequent operations.\n# Assign value 10 to variable x\nx &lt;- 10\n\n# Use x in a calculation\nx + 5  # Returns 15\n\n# Reassign x to a new value\nx &lt;- 20\nx  # Now returns 20\nWhile both &lt;- and = work for assignment in most contexts, &lt;- is preferred in R programming because it clearly distinguishes assignment from the == equality test and because it works in all contexts.\n\n\nVariable Names\nGood variable names are essential for readable code. In R:\n\nVariable names can contain letters, numbers, dots (.), and underscores (_)\nNames must start with a letter or a dot not followed by a number\nNames are case-sensitive (count and Count are different variables)\nNames should be descriptive of what they contain\n\n# Valid variable names\nage &lt;- 30\nstudent.name &lt;- \"John\"\ntest_score &lt;- 95\n\n# Invalid variable names (would cause errors)\n# 2ndPlace &lt;- \"Silver\"  # Can't start with a number\n# test-score &lt;- 95      # Can't contain hyphens\n\n\nExercise 3: Variable Assignment\nCreate variables for the following: 1.

    "text": "Vectors\nVectors are one of the most basic and important data structures in R. A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same type. It’s like a collection of values stored together.\n\nCreating Vectors\nThere are several ways to create vectors in R:\n\nUsing the c() function (combine function):\n# Create a numeric vector\nnumbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Create a character vector\ncolors &lt;- c(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\")\nUsing the colon operator : for sequences:\n# Create a sequence from 1 to 10\nseq_1_10 &lt;- 1:10  # Contains 1, 2, 3, ..., 10\nUsing the seq() function for more complex sequences:\n# Create a sequence from 0 to 1 with 0.1 steps\nseq_0_1 &lt;- seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)  # 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1\nUsing the rep() function to repeat values:\n# Repeat the value 5 four times\nrep_values &lt;- rep(5, times = 4)  # 5, 5, 5, 5\n\n\n\nVector Types\nAll elements in a vector must be of the same type. The main vector types are:\n\nNumeric vectors: contain numbers (c(1.5, 2.0, 3.5))\nInteger vectors: contain whole numbers (c(1L, 2L, 3L))\nCharacter vectors: contain text (c(\"apple\", \"banana\"))\nLogical vectors: contain TRUE or FALSE values (c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))\nDate vectors: contain date values\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Creating Vectors\nCreate vectors using different methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse c() to combine values into a vector. Use : for a sequence of consecutive numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a numeric vector using c()\nnumbers &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\nnumbers\n\n# Create a sequence using :\nsequence &lt;- 1:10\nsequence\n\n# Create a character vector\nfruits &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\")\nfruits\n\n# Create a logical vector\nflags &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)\nflags\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector Operations\nR is designed to work efficiently with vectors. Most operations are “vectorized,” meaning they apply to each element of the vector automatically.\n\nArithmetic with Vectors\nWhen you perform arithmetic operations on vectors, R applies the operation to each element:\n# Vector addition\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6)  # Returns c(5, 7, 9)\n\n# Vector multiplication\nc(1, 2, 3) * 2  # Returns c(2, 4, 6)\n\n\nVector Recycling\nIf vectors have different lengths, R “recycles” the shorter vector to match the length of the longer one:\n# Vector of length 3 plus vector of length 1\nc(1, 2, 3) + 10  # Returns c(11, 12, 13)\n\n# Vector of length 3 plus vector of length 2\nc(1, 2, 3) + c(10, 20)  # Returns c(11, 22, 13), with warning\n\n\nVector Functions\nR has many built-in functions for working with vectors:\nx &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n\nlength(x)    # Returns 5 (number of elements)\nsum(x)       # Returns 30 (sum of all elements)\nmean(x)      # Returns 6 (average of elements)\nmedian(x)    # Returns 6 (median value)\nmin(x)       # Returns 2 (minimum value)\nmax(x)       # Returns 10 (maximum value)\nsort(x)      # Returns sorted vector\nrev(x)       # Returns reversed vector\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Vector Operations\nPerform operations on vectors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can perform arithmetic operations on vectors element-by-element.
