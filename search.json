We believe that despite the dissemination of resources, the community is doing a fantastic job trying to consolidate them, and I strongly encourage anyone interested in contributing to this effort to feed the sources mentioned earlier. However, another problem remains: there is a glaring lack of exercises and interactive resources. It’s important to note that there are platforms for doing R exercises online to some degree of interactivity. Notable cases include Exercism, Codewars and W3school (for a more comprehensive list, check our blog post). There is also the learnr package, which allows creating interactive R exercises using Rmarkdown. The system is great (at least locally), but when it comes to putting exercises online for use without installing R, it requires an active server, adding more work and concerns, particularly regarding hosting and managing a large number of requests. Our goal would be to create an exercise platform that does not require running R on a server. Is this possible? The answer is yes!\n\nThe advancements in web technologies over the past few years have given us hope to create online interactive exercise platforms without a server, and it was only recently that the idea of reusing a system like learnr within webr (the Quarto extension) surfaced. These developments are very encouraging and have inspired the creation of this platform.\n\nOur association is made up of passionate individuals with varying levels, goals, and interests. But I believe we can create an interactive resource that allows curious people to train. The objective will be to create exercise series and recommend existing resources to help users complete the exercises.\n\nThis is new territory for me, and I don’t know if it will work. Perhaps I’m missing essential elements, or web pages might be unbelievably slow or inefficient. But I believe it’s worth a try!\n\n\n\nAs we said earlier, thanks to webr, it’s now possible to use R in the browser without the need for a server (a computer that’s always running). To be more precise, R is translated into WebAssembly, which runs in the browser. All thanks to webr. If you don’t believe me, you can try R in the browser here. Or you can test it just below using the code or writting yours:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic! You can use it without an R, even on your cell phone!\nQuarto’s strength lies in its ability to integrate it so seamlessly into its ecosystem. This has enabled the same webr authors to create the quarto-live extension, which adds the elements needed to create online exercises. So we can easily create interactive online exercises simply by hosting our website on a GitHub repository, with no real performance problems.\nWe can thank quarto-live for this feat. Here is an example of an exercise suggested in the documentation:\nFilter the starwars dataset so that only the droid characters are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider using the filter() function from dplyr.\nstarwars |&gt; filter(______)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should filter the dataset using the species column.\nstarwars |&gt; filter(species == ______)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFully worked solution:\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the filter() function from dplyr:\n1starwars |&gt;\n2    filter(species == \"Droid\")\n\n1\n\nTake the starwars dataset, and then,\n\n2\n\nFilter for the “Droid” species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic!

This statement is ignored by the interpreter and serves as documentation for our code. The short cut for this is Ctrl+Maj+C or Cmd+Maj+C.\nLine 2: print(“Hello World!”) To print something on the console, print() function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed (unlike in C). Note that in R you can also use the cat() function for a more readable version:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: To see the document related to the function or library in:\n\nRStudio: appears automatically\nVScode: appears automatically or Ctrl+Space or hover the function\nJupyter lab/notebook: Shift+Tab.\n\nCurly brackets: Like many programming languages, R does not care about the spaces because it is always bound to brackets (parentheses, brackets or curly brackets). Indentation is only for aesthetic matter and users are free to indent their code following their taste (unlike Python or Nim that can have an indentation error). For example, the indentation of the second print() does not break the code since it is in the brackets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRstudio:\n\nCode is run inside an environment (R version, project and environment). It can always be stopped by pressing the “Stop” button or Ctrl+C shortcut (inside quarto/rmarkdown notebook or a script).\n\nJupyter lab/notebook:\n\nCode is run in a separate process called the Kernel. The Kernel can be interrupted or restarted. Try running the following cell and then hit the “Stop” button in the toolbar above or by clicking the right button on the script in jupyter Lab.\n\nIndexing in R starts at 1, which means that the first element in a sequence has an index of 1, the second element has an index of 2, and so on as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You need a double bracket to have access to a list element (see last lines of code).\nTips: You can generate a continuous vector between two values using the sign : as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also decide to use specific steps to get from one value to another using the seq() function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR reserved words\nR has reserved words that you can use as a variable name (except if you surround it by `). Otherwise, R is smart enough to know which element you are talking about even though, function, package and variable names have the same name."

    "text": "Manipulating data with dplyr\nIt is possible to manipulate dataset (here called data frames) using base R functionalities. However, the dplyr make this manipulation easier. You need to install it firts with install.package(\"dplyr\") then load the library with library(dplyr):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo import a csv you can use the function read.csv() in base R, but the read_csv() in dplyr is faster and import everything as tibble table (an advanced kind of dataframe):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that to have access to the data, you do not need to write the full path, you can simply press the key Tab inside the quotation mark of a\nDisplay a dataframe:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the size of your dataframe:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the names of columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new column the base R way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new column with Tidyverse (without pipe):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR has a super power as a functional programming language. It can use pipes (|&gt; and %&gt;%). Those allows to pass the result of an operation to the next operation and therfore chain multiple operations. It allows to have a more readable code, easier to write and more composable. You can use 2 kinds of pipes:\n\nmagrittr pipe (%&gt;%): Powerful (can do more than the next one), it needs to be installed through a package of the Tidyverse (magrittr, dplyr, rvest, …).\nBase (|&gt;): useful, do not need any libraries\n\nSince we will use the dplyr, we will use magrittr pipe (%&gt;%). No need to write it, simply use the following shortcut Ctrl+Maj+M or Cmd+Maj+M. With a few try, it comes naturally. As said before the pipe use is to pass values through operations. For instance consider the following example printing the value of the variable a:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey both give the same result. However the pipe version is longer. The strength of the secon approach appear when we need more than one operation. For instance, imagine converting a to an integer before printing it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first one still looks more concise, but it is in fact slower and harder to write. You have to start by the print() statement (the end) and go backward until the beginning which is counter-intuitive. While with the pipe approach you can consider %&gt;% as a “and”. Writting it looks like, “I start with the variable ‘a’ AND I convert it into an integer AND I print it”.\nThis method scale also really well. Lets take a more extreme example. With the following steps:\n\nTranslate “a” into an integer\nCompute the log10\nCompute the square root\nPrint it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in this code we can put expressions following a pipe in the next line for more readability. But the whole code is considered by R as only one line. So, you can run the code from whatever line and it will run the whole expression.\nIt is even more complicated with the normal way and less readable. While with pipe you can read it like sentences connected by “AND”. Generally, when operation start to stack, we desagreggate them into multiple steps like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach is more readable. The issue with this approach is that we have changed the value of a multiple time. But if we want to go back in a step, we need to re-run all the step before. It seems like nothing, but in a longer code and more complex, you can easily be overwhelmed and lost track of the state of your variable. You could improve that by storing new values in different variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then we can create unecessary intermediate variables that have only no usage beside storing value that have no use in the rest of the code. Furthermore, both version are slower to write than the pipe version. Another advantage of the pipe function is that we can iteratively write the code and add and remove steps as needed. The when you are satisfied with the result, you can store it in a final variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pipes in dplyr allows to manipulate data frames steps by steps in a readable manner. But function from the tidyverse bring another strength. They always return data frame, makin the iteratino even easier since you keep everything, so modifying a single column won’t stop you to do other manipulation with other columns in the same chain. Let’s take the earlier example from the df dataframe and compute the mean of Open and Close columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last expression return a data frame and added the new column to the end. Again you are free to put the new result in a new object. Then you can select specific rows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine it with the previous operation to chain everything. The new dataset has a new column mean_value and is filterd to keep row when Close is bigger than Open:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can display the summary statistic of a given variable using the summary() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can do the same with the whole data frame:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also request specific statistics using the corresponding functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChaining is useful when we need to answer a specific question without changing the data frame. For instance, you can find the date when Volume was highest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut sometimes, it is faster to use base R for simple isolated operations. For instance, the Date column in df is note in the date format but in text format. We can change it in one line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to extract the specific value and not a data frame, you can use the pull() function instead of select():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots are very easy in ggplot2 with qplot()! But there is another notation that is more used, the layered one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks longer, but it is more flexible. It works like layers. Here is a short explanation of each part: - ggplot() initiate te figure - aes() map the column to different dimensions (x/y axis, color, line type, size, etc.) - geom_*() create a type of geometry - geom_line() create line using value from x and y\nThe aes() part is quite movable. You can decide to put it in a different place to update the graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get the same result. The advantage of using such an approach is that we can really be flexible in the parameter that we are using and also the number of layer that we can create:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust by changing the geom, we can have a large variety of plots. For instance here is a boxplot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the parameters are not compulsary as long as we keep theme in the righ order (x then y):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping the same structure, we can have different plots by changing the geom:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a whole subject by itself and the Tidyverse ecosystem (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, …) is an even bigger topic. We won’t talk about it here, but in future tutorials."
